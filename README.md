## üìò Overview

This repository contains the final project for the **‚ÄúAn Introduction to Programming using Python‚Äù** course from **Coursera**, completed as part of my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** curriculum.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a robust, from-scratch implementation of a complex pathfinding algorithm. The script builds a "brain" for a robot to find the shortest possible path from a starting point ('R') to a goal ('G') in a 2D text-based grid, navigating around obstacles ('X').

The project's two primary objectives are:

1. To implement the **A* (A-Star) search algorithm** using foundational Python data structures.
    
2. To provide a **step-by-step console animation** of the robot's movement along the calculated optimal path.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

```
robot-pathfinding-using-python/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ robot.py
```

The repository is built around a single, self-contained Python script (`robot.py`) that includes all helper functions, the A* algorithm logic, and the final visualization.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Vishwajit1610/robot-pathfinding-using-python
cd robot-pathfinding-using-python
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project uses only Python's built-in libraries (`heapq` and `time`), so **no `requirements.txt` file or external package installation is necessary.**

### 4. Run the Script

Simply run the `robot.py` file to see the pathfinding and animation in your terminal:

```
python robot.py
```

## üß© Project Components

### üß† The A* Algorithm Engine

The **"brain"** of the robot is a complete implementation of the A* search algorithm. It efficiently finds the shortest path by always exploring the most promising square on the grid. It makes this decision using a heuristic formula:

**`f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`**

- **`g(n)`:** The true cost (number of steps) from the start to the current square `n`.
    
- **`h(n)`:** The heuristic, or estimated cost, from `n` to the goal. This project uses the **Manhattan distance** for a fast and effective estimate.
    

### üì¶ Key Data Structures

- **`heapq` (Priority Queue):** The `open_set` list is managed as a priority queue to ensure the algorithm always processes the square with the lowest `f_score` first.
    
- **`g_score` (Dictionary):** Tracks the "pedometer" cost (the `g(n)` value) for each explored square.
    
- **`came_from` (Dictionary):** Stores the "breadcrumb trail" used to reconstruct the final path by tracing it backward from the goal.
    

### üé¨ Console Animation

The "legs" of the robot. Once the A* algorithm finds the optimal path, a dedicated animation loop takes over to provide a step-by-step visualization:

1. The initial grid state is displayed.
    
2. The loop iterates through the calculated path.
    
3. In each step, the robot's previous position is updated (leaving a `‚óè` trail), and the robot `'R'` is drawn in its new position.
    
4. The grid is re-printed, and `time.sleep()` is called to create a visible, step-by-step movement.

## üß† Key Learning Outcomes

- Practical, from-scratch implementation of the **A* pathfinding algorithm**.
    
- Proficient use of **`heapq`** to manage a priority queue for an efficient search.
    
- Advanced use of **dictionaries** for cost-tracking (`g_score`) and path reconstruction (`came_from`).
    
- Strong procedural programming practices by separating logic into helper functions (`is_move_valid`, `reconstruct__path`, etc.).
    
- Creating dynamic **console-based animations** and visualizations using `print` and `time.sleep`.

## üöÄ Future Additions

This project serves as a strong foundation for more advanced work:

- **Graphical Interface:** Rebuild the visualization using a library like **Pygame** or **Tkinter** to create a graphical, real-time representation (as seen in the project's inspiration image).
    
- **Weighted Grids:** Introduce "difficult terrain" (e.g., 'water' or 'mud') that costs more than 1 step to move through, testing the full power of the A* algorithm.
    
- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Add logic for the robot to re-calculate its path if a new 'X' appears in its way.
